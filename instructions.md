# Instructions
## Overview

The final stage of your game project is to make your game awesome. This is your chance to show off your skills in terms of graphics and to produce a polished game project! So try to make your graphics as pretty as possible. 

### Extensions

Furthermore, you need to add one out of three possible extensions shown below.

1. ~~Add sounds~~

Use p5.sound to add sound effects to your game. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this.

2. ~~Create platforms~~

Use the factory pattern to create platforms. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this.

3. ~~Create enemies~~

Use a constructor function to create enemies. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this.

### Make your code awesome

Secondly, review your code and make sure it is awesome. This means:

    Make sure your code is well-formatted. If you're unsure how to do this, then rewatch the code philosophy video "The elegant coder".

    Make sure that you have used variables, objects and functions well. The code philosophy lecture, "The elegant coder" can also provide help for this area.

    Make sure your code works as well as can be. Iron out those bugs. Code philosophy videos "The debugger's mindset" and "Testing" will help you in your approach to this.

## Deliverables

Hand in your final game project as a zipped folder containing:

    your final game project code

    all assets needed to run the code (html files, library files, images, sound files etc).

Write a comment of around 150 words at the top of your code explaining:

    your extension

    the bits you found difficult

    the skills you learnt/practised by implementing it
