# Objects
Each object is documented in its own folder.  

<br>

Each folder contains:  
1. an `object` file  
2. a `p5.js project`  

<br>

Finally, each object must be loaded into its project's `index.js` file as well as the game's `index.js` by including the below within the head section of the index file.

```javascript
<script src="[Path to Entity].js"></script>
```
