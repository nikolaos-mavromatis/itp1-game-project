# Objects
Each object is documented in its own folder.  

<br>

Each folder contains:  
1. an `object` file  
    - contains the object class
1. a `p5.js project`  
    - can be run as a standalone version
    - used to check design, functionality, interaction, etc.

<br>

Finally, each object must be loaded into its project's `index.js` file as well as the game's `index.js` by including the below within the head section of the index file.

```javascript
<script src="[Path to .js Object File]"></script>
```
